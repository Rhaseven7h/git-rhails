Welcome to the git-rails wiki!

It’s easy to use.

It’s a bash shell script, so, just

   1. Be sure to have git installed
   2. Copy this script to /usr/local/bin
   3. chmod +x /usr/local/bin/git-rails
   4. Move to your rails’ project top directory
   5. type: git-rails, and all the magic is done.

Hope you like it, if you have doubts, questions, suggestions or changes, please mail me at rha7.com[at]gmail.com.

Thanks for visiting.
